# Private Life Coach (name pending)
This is an iOS app that does the following:
* Asks the user initial questions about some things they want to improve in their lives
* Feeds that information to a locally-running LLM (Coach) that does not communicate with the Internet
* Analyzes phone activity and behavior periodically for any potential deviations from stated behaviors and goals (only with explicit user consent)
* Provides a safe and welcoming space to talk to Coach without any of the user's questions and answers leaving the physical device (no cloud use)
